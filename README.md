# Vector_class
An implementation of std::vector!
Tried to make this as cross-platform as I could, and I'm sure it compiles well on macOS, Windows and Fedora.

# Why
I wrote this as an exercise while deep-learning data structures and memory management in C++. This is a fairly simple implementation of std::vector, tweakable as much as you want it to be and it's pretty sweet.
I also left a Vector3 implementation in main.cpp, for testing purposes. All code is commented and working.
# How
Check the code, there's more comments than code itself!
